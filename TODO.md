# TODO:
* [x] Initial commit.
* [x] Do not show several calls of the same function.
* [x] Correctly display recursion.
* [x] Logging.
* [ ] Recognize calls through function pointers from function argument.
* [ ] Recognize calls through assigned function pointers.
* [x] Preprocessing for a faster chain generation (useful for big projects).
* [x] Use pygraphviz instead of generating gv files.
* [ ] Implement a different CodeQuery (if needed).
* [ ] Grouping files in graph.
* [ ] Grouping functions of the same name in graph (possibly conflicing with the previous TODO).
* [x] Label link with line number.
* [ ] Handle missing definitions and still display them in the graph.
* [ ] Optionally add more include folders to the CodeQuery.
